        I’ve always craved attention, and when I was younger I’d do anything to
        get it. Hearing jokes from a funny video and retelling it to the other
        school kids (<span class="italic">I’d always butcher it</span>), getting <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1qZsJsawZI" target="_blank" class="underline">
          good at video games</a>
          ,but the thing that really stuck in middle school was making websites.
        Or let me clarify, memorizing the boilerplate html template and just
        adding in an H1 tag, <span class="font-bold">I’m a hacker</span>. The other kids loved it. And I
        was hooked.
        <br />
        <br />
        I remember forcing my dad to take me to the library where I checked out the
        first programming book I saw, <a
          href="https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html" target="_blank" class="underline">
          Programming in Lua.</a>
        And not to be anti climatic but I didn’t really do much with it. I made a
        few hello worlds, added some numbers, you know the whole works when a 12
        year old tries to get into something. But that never killed my love for computers.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now a days I really do enjoy the whole process at any level, from making
        a crappy python web scrapper to show how much tacobell I had during lent,
        to making a journal site that takes a persons mood for each entry and their
        Spotify and plays music according to their mood
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently working on of course another Spotify related app
